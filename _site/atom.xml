<p>Today we are going to attack a group theory problem that has a little bit of a combinatorial flavour.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Problem</strong>. Find an upper bound on the maximum probability that two randomly chosen elements of a finite non-abelian group commute, and show that it is attained.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>Suppose that we have a group $G$, and a random element $g \in G$. We have then got two cases.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If $g$ commutes with everything, then the probability that $g$ commutes with another element is obviously 1.</li>
  <li>If $g$ does not commute with everything, we need to find the probability that it commutes with a random other element.</li>
</ol>

<p>This gives us two things to compute (or more correctly, to bound): the probability that a random element commutes with everything, and the probability that if it does not commute with everything, then it commutes with a random element.
The natural approach is then clearly thinking about centers and centralisers.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>Let $G$ be a finite group. If it is non-abelian, then its center $Z(G)$ is not the entire group, that is, $G$ has some element $g \not \in Z(G)$.
Then $C_G(g)$, centraliser of $g$, also cannot be the entire group, as that would contradict $z \not \in Z(G)$.</p>

<p>Noting that $C_G(g) \leq G$, and $Z(G) \leq C_G(g)$, we can then apply Lagrange’s theorem twice to get</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
|Z(G)| \leq \frac{1}{2} |C_G(g)| \leq \frac{1}{4}|G|.
$$</div>

<p>Now let $x$, $y$ be a random elements of $G$. We can bound the probability that they commute with</p>

<div class="kdmath">$$
\mathbb{P}(x\in Z(G)) + \mathbb{P}(x \not \in Z(G)) \cdot \mathbb{P}(y \in C_G(x)) \leq \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{8}.
$$</div>

<p>This bound is achieved by the Quaternion group $Q_8$.</p>

<p>This is a collection of groups that have specific interesting
properties, such as being a counterexample to some non-obvious
statements about groups. Most of these are well known.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>A group isomorphic to every non-trivial subgroup</strong>. $\mathbb{Z}$.</li>
  <li>
<strong>A group of order $n$ which has no subgroup of $k$, where $k \mid n$</strong>.
$A_5$, since it is simple and thus has no subgroup of index 2. Another
example is $A_4$ (which is the smallest such group), but it’s a little
harder to show that it works.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Two non-isomorphic groups with the same order type</strong>. $C_4 \times C_4$
and $C_2 \times Q_8$. Both have 1 element of order 1, 3 elements of
order 2, and 12 elements of order 4. If this property holds for two
abelian groups, then they are isomorphic.</li>
  <li>
<strong>A non-abelian group with all non-identity elements of order $p$</strong>. The
group of upper triangular $3 \times 3$ matrices over $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ with 1s on
the diagonal.</li>
  <li>
<strong>A non-abelian group of order $p^3$</strong>. Same as above.</li>
  <li>
<strong>An infinite group whose proper subgroups are all finite</strong>. The group
$\left\{k/2^{n} : k, n \in \mathbb{N}, k&lt;2^{n}\right\}$ with addition
modulo 1. This is the Prüfer $2$-group.</li>
  <li>
<strong>A group $G$ with $N \trianglelefteq G$ and $H \trianglelefteq N$ such that
$H \not \trianglelefteq G$</strong>. In $D_8$, we have
$\langle s \rangle \trianglelefteq \langle r^2, s \rangle \trianglelefteq \langle r, s \rangle = D_4$,
but $\langle s \rangle \not \trianglelefteq D_4$.</li>
  <li>
<strong>A group in which every group generated by $n$ elements has a
surjective homomorphism to it</strong>. The free group with a basis of $n$
elements.</li>
  <li>
<strong>An infinite group with every non-identity element of order 2</strong>.
$C_2 \times C_2 \times C_2 \times \cdots$.</li>
  <li>
<strong>An infinite non-abelian group with every element of finite order</strong>.
$S_3 \times C_2 \times C_2 \times \cdots$.</li>
  <li>
<strong>A group $G$ with $G \cong G \times G$</strong>.
$G = C_2 \times C_2 \times C_2 \times \cdots$. We can also get
$G \cong G \times G \times G \times \cdots$ in the natural way.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Two non-zero elements of $\mathbb{R}$ that generate a subgroup not isomorphic
to $\mathbb{Z}$</strong>. $1$ and $\sqrt{2}$.</li>
  <li>
<strong>A group with two subgroups whose product is not a subgroup</strong>. Consider
$D_3$, with the distinct reflections $s, s’ \in D_3$. Then
${e, s} \times {e, s’} \not \leq D_3$.</li>
  <li>
<strong>A quotient group of a finite group that is not isomorphic to a
subgroup</strong>. $Q_8 / {-1, 1}$.</li>
  <li>
<strong>A group isomorphic to its automorphism group</strong>.
$S_3 \cong \operatorname{Aut}(S_3)$.</li>
  <li>
<strong>A non-abelian infinite group where the set of elements of finite order
is a subgroup</strong>. $\operatorname{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q})$. We note that this also holds for all
abelian groups, and indeed any group where the elements of finite order
commute with each other.</li>
  <li>
<strong>A group that is not a semi-direct product</strong>. $Q_8$.</li>
  <li>
<strong>A group $G$ with two isomorphic subgroups $H, K$ where $G/H$ and $G/K$
are not isomorphic</strong>. Take $G = C_4 \times C_2$, with
$H = \langle (2, 0) \rangle$ and $K = \langle (0, 1)\rangle$. Then
$G/H \cong C_2 \times C_2$, and $G/K \cong C_4$.</li>
</ul>
