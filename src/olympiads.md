Here are some notes and problem sets that I created while preparing for various mathematical olympaids.

## Handouts

- [Inversion]() -- Based on Evan Chen's _Euclidean Geometry in Mathematical Olympiads_
- [Geometry Revisited - Before Transformations]() -- A rather brief summary of the first three chapters of H. S. M. Coxeter and S. L. Greitzer's _Geometry Revisited_

## Problem Sets

The following is a collection of problems that have appeared on the Irish Mathematical Olympaid (IrMO) or the Irish EGMO selection test. The questions are grouped by topic.

- [IrMO Algebra]()
- [IrMO Combinatorics]()
- [IrMO Functional Equations]()
- [IrMO Geometry]()
- [IrMO Number Theory]()
- [IrMO Inequalities]()
